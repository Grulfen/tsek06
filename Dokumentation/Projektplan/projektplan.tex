\section{Customer}
The customer is Amin Ojani from the department of Electrical Engineering, Linköping University.

\section{Project Outline}
This project is the main part of the course TSEK06 - VLSI Chip Design Project.
The purpose of this project is to design a DLL-Based frequency multiplier.
DLL stands for delay-lock loop.

\subsection{Project Goal}
From \cite{project_spec} ``The project goal is to design an integrated circuit
(IC) in complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Students, participating in this project as
project members
and project leaders, should learn the different steps of the IC design flow.
That includes the
given system architecture analysis, simulation, layout implementation and
verification. The
project students have an optional choice to manufacture the designed IC circuit
on a chip. To
test the manufactured chips, another course (TSEK11) is available after the
project.''

\end{LIPSleveranslista}


\subsection{Limitations}
The final chip shall fulfill the requirements specified in section
\ref{sec:requirements}.
The requirements with priority level High will be focused on first and the other
requirements
will be focused on only after all the requirements with higher priority level
have been met.

\section{System Components}

The system consists of the following components.

\subsection{Phase Detector}
The Phase Detector (PD) is in charge of checking whether the input frequency 
and the produced frequency are in phase. The reference frequency is used as an 
input for a D flip-flop (DFF), while the produced frequency clock is used as 
the input of the DFF. If the produced signal is running late, it will not yet 
have risen when it should have, which means that the output from the DFF 
should be set low. Respectively, the output from the DFF will be high if the 
signal is running early. The output from the DFF will then be sent to the 
counter for further processing.

If the output from the PD starts toggling between low and high the phases of 
the clocks are as close to in phase as they can be. When this happens, the PD 
as well as the counter will be shut off to save energy. This will result in 
the reference and produced clocks to shift slightly and after a while they will 
not be in phase anymore. When this happens the PD and counter will be turned 
on again to get them into phase once more.

\subsection{Digital Counter}
The Digital Counter is used to determine how the delay line is supposed to 
adjust for the phase of the produced counter signal. It takes the output from 
the PD and if the output is high, it increments the internal value, while it 
decreases the internal value if the output from the PD is low. The input value 
is then used to determine how much the delay line should delay the signal. 

\subsection{Delay Line}

The delay line delays the signal in steps, the output between the steps will be
combined to produce the output signal of the system. The main components
of the delay line are an even number of inverters.  When the input signal has
passed through the entire delay line it will have been phase-shifted 360\degree. 
The delay of each stage will be set by binary-weighted capacitive loads
controlled by the output from the 6-bit binary counter. Preliminary  the
system will have 8 delay stages, each delaying the signal 45\degree. This makes
it possible to generate an output frequency 4 times that of the input. With this
it is also possible to choose signal components so that the output frequency is
2 times that of the input.

Depending on available space on the chip and available time the preliminary
number of 8 delay stages might be increased further. For example to a total of
16 stages giving 8 times the input frequency on the output. However, since space
is limited this improvement will hold low priority.

\subsection{Frequency Multiplier}
The frequency multiplier combines multiple phase-shifted versions of the input
signal to a higher frequency signal, essentially multiplying the frequency of
the input signal. This can be accomplished by letting the phase-shifted
signals be inputs to a multiplexer and the output of the multiplexer is the 
clock input to a counter. The output of the counter controls the multiplexer.
The frequency multiplied output is taken from the LSB of the counter output.

Preliminary the system will have 8 phase-shifted signals, 
each delayed 45\degree with respect to the previous signal.
Therefore a 3-bit counter is necessary. The LSB of the counter output will 
have a frequency that is 4 times the frequency of the input signal.
A block diagram of the frequency multiplier can be seen in 
figure \ref{fig:freq_mult}.

\section{Project Phases} 
This section briefly describes the outline of the different phases of the
project.
\subsection{Before Project}
Before starting with the high level design of the DLL the group will hold
preparatory meetings for planning the project and specify the written project
plan. The group members will also study up on relevant material concerning
functionality and implementation of a DLL.
  
\subsection{Under Project}
The project will start with implementing a high level model of the DLL using
the hardware definition language Verilog-A and running simulation on this
model. Thereafter the model will be implemented on gate/transistor level followed by
simulation. When the DLL behaves correctly on transistor level the work will
continue with the layout of the chip, DRC, parasitic extraction, LVS,
post-layout simulations, modification and chip evaluations. Finally the chip
layout will be sent to the foundry for fabrication.

\subsection{After Project}
When the chip layout has been sent to the foundry for fabrication a presentation
will be held where the stages of the project and results will be presented. 
Thereafter a more detailed final report will be written and submitted to the 
concerned parties. With this the project is considered finalized. In HT-13 there
is a course where the produced chip can be tested. The majority of the project
group members will take this course at this occasion.
